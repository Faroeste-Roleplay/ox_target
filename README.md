This script is originally based on [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target), developed by Overextended. However, it was rewritten by **klandestino7** to work exclusively on **RedM**.

The main focus was to adapt the "third-eye" system to meet the needs of RedM servers, ensuring performance, flexibility, and compatibility with the frameworks used on the platform.

## ðŸš€ Compatibility

The script was initially developed for **FRP Framework** and later ported to other frameworks, such as:

- **VORP**
- **REDEMRP**
- **RSG**

## ðŸ“š Documentation

The original ox_target documentation can be found at:
